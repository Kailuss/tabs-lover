# Tabs Lover 💙

**Your tabs, beautifully organized in the sidebar.**

Tabs Lover gives you a clean, vertical tab list that replaces VS Code's native horizontal tab bar. All your open files in one elegant sidebar panel — no more horizontal scrolling or lost tabs.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Install** the extension from the VS Code Marketplace
2. **Open** the Tabs Lover panel from the Activity Bar (look for the icon on the left)
3. **Enjoy** your organized tabs!

That's it. No configuration needed — it works great out of the box.

## ✨ What You Get

### 📋 Clean Vertical Layout
- All your tabs in one sidebar panel
- File name and path on separate lines for easy scanning

- Visual highlight on your active file

### 🎯 Quick Actions on Hover
- **Pin** important files to keep them at the top
- **Close** tabs without hunting for tiny X buttons  
- **Add to Copilot Chat** for AI assistance with your code
- Everything appears when you hover — no clutter when you don't need it

### 🔍 Powerful Right-Click Menu
- Close other tabs to focus on what matters
- Reveal files in the Explorer
- Copy file paths for sharing
- Compare files side-by-side
- Move tabs between editor groups

### 🎨 Smart File Actions
- **Preview** Markdown, HTML, images, and CSV files

- **Open** external files (PDFs, videos, etc.) in their native apps
- **Format** JSON, CSS, and YAML files
- **Optimize** SVG files and compile SCSS/Less
- **Send** HTTP requests from `.http` files

### 👥 Multi-Window Support
When you split your editor, Tabs Lover groups your tabs automatically. Each group gets its own header so you always know what's where.
